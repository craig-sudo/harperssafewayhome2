After birth, babies often experience withdrawal symptoms (e.g., tremors, irritability, feeding issues) because their bodies are adjusting to the absence of the drug. + Stimulants: Increase brain activity but don't usually cause physical dependence. Instead, they may affect brain development, leading to potential issues like hyperactivity, poor attention, or low birth weight.

After birth, babies often experience withdrawal symptoms (e.g., tremors, irritability, feeding issues) because their bodies are adjusting to the absence of the drug. + Stimulants: Increase brain activity but don't usually cause physical dependence. Instead, they may affect brain development, leading to potential issues like hyperactivity, poor attention, or low birth weight.

Add wheels (optional but slick): Put small wheels just beneath the hook so you can roll it up without shredding the shingles. 4. Reinforce everything: Don't be shy with bracing and testing.

Fun Fact: \u00ab If a cuckoo clock has three weights, the third one is for extra features like music or moving figurines. So, in short\u2014gravity does all the work, and your job is just to pull the chains up once a day (or once a week, if it\u2019s an 8-day clock) to keep the magic happening. Message + \u00a9 2 @ Fe",
