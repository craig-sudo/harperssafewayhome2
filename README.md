f# Harper's Safeway Home Evidence Processor

A professional Python-based OCR evidence processing system designed for legal documentation. This system processes screenshots and images to extract and structure text data into organized CSV files suitable for legal proceedings.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tool automates the processing of large volumes of screenshot evidence (text messages, emails, documents) by:
- Extracting text using advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Automatically categorizing content by legal relevance
- Structuring data into organized CSV format for legal review
- Providing batch processing capabilities for efficiency
- Generating summary reports for case preparation

## 📊 Output Format

The system generates structured CSV files with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `File_Name` | Original image filename |
| `Date_Time_Approx` | Extracted date/time from screenshot |
| `Sender` | Message sender (automatically detected) |
| `Recipient` | Message recipient |
| `Key_Factual_Statement` | Extracted text content |
| `Relevance_Code` | Auto-categorized legal relevance |
| `Processing_Status` | SUCCESS/FAILED status |
| `Confidence_Score` | OCR confidence percentage |

### Automatic Categorization

The system automatically categorizes content using these relevance codes:

- **VIOLENCE**: Physical altercations, threats of harm
- **SUBSTANCE**: Drug-related content, substance abuse
- **OBSTRUCTION**: Denial, blocking, refusal to cooperate
- **CUSTODY**: Child custody, visitation, court matters
- **THREATS**: Intimidation, revenge threats
- **FINANCIAL**: Money, support payments, debts
- **COMMUNICATION**: General messaging, contact attempts
- **REVIEW_REQUIRED**: Uncategorized content needing manual review

## �️ Evidence Viewer (App-like UI)

Browse OCR CSV results in an easy, searchable web UI (no extra installs):

```bat
# Windows
RUN_VIEWER.bat

# Or via Python
python evidence_viewer.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8777 in your browser.

- Review items marked as `REVIEW_REQUIRED`
- Cross-reference with original screenshots

### Documentation
- Keep processing logs for audit trail
- Generate summary reports for case preparation
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Tesseract not found" Error**:
   - Install Tesseract OCR
   - Update `tesseract_cmd` in `config/settings.py`

2. **Poor OCR Results**:
   - Ensure images are high resolution
   - Check image quality and contrast
   - Adjust OCR configuration parameters

3. **No Images Found**:
   - Verify images are in correct folder
   - Check file extensions are supported
   - Ensure proper file permissions

### Performance Optimization

- Use high-quality source images when possible
- Consider image preprocessing for challenging screenshots

## 📝 Example Workflow

1. **Preparation**:
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Configure Tesseract path if needed
   - Organize screenshots by conversation/topic

2. **Processing**:
   - Add images to `custody_screenshots/` folder
   - Run processor: Use VS Code task or `python evidence_processor.py`
   - Monitor progress in terminal output

3. **Review**:
   - Open generated CSV in Excel/spreadsheet application
   - Review `Relevance_Code` categorizations
   - Verify important dates and details
   - Filter by categories for focused analysis

4. **Legal Preparation**:
   - Export filtered data for specific legal issues
   - Cross-reference with case timeline
   - Generate summary reports for court submissions

## 🔐 Security & Privacy
