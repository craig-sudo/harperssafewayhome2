## SHA256 Verification Protocol

### What is SHA256?

SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a unique 64-character hexadecimal "fingerprint" for any file. **Any change to a file, no matter how small, produces a completely different hash.** This makes it ideal for verifying file integrity in legal proceedings.

### Verification Process

#### 1. Hash Extraction from CSV
The system reads hash values from your processed CSV files:

```csv
filename,file_hash,file_path,text_content,...
screenshot_001.png,a3f5d8c2e1b9...,custody_screenshots/...,Text from image...
```

**Field names recognized:**
- `file_hash`
- `original_file_sha256`
- `processed_file_sha256`

#### 2. Cross-Reference with Integrity Database
If `evidence_integrity.db` exists (created by `evidence_integrity_checker.py`), the system cross-references hashes:

```sql
SELECT status, validation_date, notes 
FROM integrity_validation 
WHERE file_hash = 'a3f5d8c2e1b9...'
```

**Verification statuses:**
- `VERIFIED` - Hash present and validated
- `WARNING` - Hash present but with notes
- `UNKNOWN` - No hash available

#### 3. Exhibit Report Generation
Each exhibit PDF includes a **SHA256 Verification Section** with:

```
SHA256 CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION
Status: VERIFIED
Verified: 2025-10-22

Original File SHA256:
a3f5d8c2e1b9f4d7e6c5b8a1d2e3f4g5h6i7j8k9l0m1n2o3p4q5r6s7t8u9v0w1x2

Verification Notes:
Verified against integrity DB on 2025-10-21
```

#### 4. Defensibility Statement
The system generates an affidavit-ready statement confirming:
- Total exhibits and verification rate
- SHA256 integrity protocol used
- Chain of custody maintained
- Industry-standard cryptographic practices

**Example excerpt:**
> "Each exhibit has been assigned a unique cryptographic fingerprint (SHA256 hash) at the time of original capture, and this hash has been preserved throughout all processing stages. The SHA256 cryptographic hash function produces a unique 64-character hexadecimal fingerprint for each file. Any modification to a file, no matter how minor, produces a completely different hash value."

## Weighted Evidence Score (S_w)

### Formula

```
S_w = (Priority_Weight × Category_Weight) + Recency_Factor
```

### Weights

**Priority Weights:**
- HIGH: 10
- MEDIUM: 5
- LOW: 2
- UNKNOWN: 1

**Category Weights:** (see table above)

**Recency Factor:**
- Adds 0.5 points per year after 2020
- Example: 2024 evidence gets +2.0 points

### Examples

1. **High-priority assault evidence from 2024**
   - Priority: HIGH (10) × Category: ASSAULT (10) = 100
   - Recency: (2024-2020) × 0.5 = +2.0
   - **Final Score: 102.0**

2. **Medium-priority email evidence from 2023**
   - Priority: MEDIUM (5) × Category: COMMUNICATION (4) = 20
   - Recency: (2023-2020) × 0.5 = +1.5
   - **Final Score: 21.5**

### Usage

Exhibits are sorted by weighted score in the master index, with **highest scores first**. This ensures the most critical evidence is reviewed and presented first.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

1. **Ensure processed CSVs exist**
   - Run your OCR processing first
   - CSVs should be in `/output` directory
   - CSVs should include `file_hash` or `original_file_sha256` fields

2. **Place external data** (optional)
   - Create `/external_data` directory
   - Add GeoJSON files for location data
   - Add email CSV files
   - Verify file formats

3. **Run integrity checks** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python evidence_integrity_checker.py --scan
   ```
   This creates/updates the integrity database for cross-verification.

### Step 2: Run Legal Triage

```bash
python legal_triage_suite.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Loads all processed CSV files
2. Scans external data directory
3. Categorizes each piece of evidence
4. Calculates weighted scores
5. Verifies SHA256 integrity
6. Generates master exhibit index
7. Creates defensibility statement

**Output:**
- `EXHIBIT_INDEX_FDSJ739_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - Master index with all metadata
- `DEFENSIBILITY_STATEMENT_FDSJ739_YYYYMMDD.txt` - Affidavit statement

**Options:**
```bash
python legal_triage_suite.py --stats           # Quick statistics only
python legal_triage_suite.py --generate-pdfs   # Also generate PDFs (slow)
```

### Step 3: Generate PDF Exhibits

```bash
python exhibit_generator.py --index EXHIBIT_INDEX_FDSJ739_20251022_123456.csv
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads the master exhibit index
2. Creates a professional PDF for each exhibit
3. Includes SHA256 verification details
4. Formats for court submission

**Options:**
```bash
python exhibit_generator.py --index [FILE] --limit 10   # Generate first 10 only (testing)
```

**Requirements:**
- Requires `reportlab` library
- Install with: `pip install reportlab`

### Step 4: Review and Package

1. **Review the exhibit index CSV**
   - Open in Excel or similar
   - Sort by `weighted_score` (highest first)
   - Review categorization
   - Check verification status

2. **Review PDF exhibits**
   - Spot-check high-priority exhibits
   - Verify SHA256 hashes are present
   - Ensure content is appropriate for court

3. **Prepare court package**
   ```bash
   python court_package_exporter.py --mode comprehensive
   ```
   This creates a ZIP package with all exhibits ready for submission.

- Evidence integrity through SHA256 verification
- Chain of custody maintenance
- System reliability and industry standards
- Suitable for legal admission

### Generated Content

The system automatically generates a statement including:

1. **Case identification**
   - Case ID: FDSJ739
   - Date of generation
   - Total exhibits and verification rate

2. **Technical methodology**
   - SHA256 cryptographic hashing
   - Chain of custody protocols
   - Automated OCR with manual review
   - Weighted scoring algorithms

3. **External data integration**
   - GeoJSON location data handling
   - Email transcript processing
   - Hash-upon-ingestion protocol

4. **SHA256 explanation**
   - What it is
   - How it ensures integrity
   - Why it's defensible in court

### Example Excerpt

```
I hereby certify that the evidence presented in this matter has been 
processed, verified, and packaged using industry-standard cryptographic 
hashing (SHA256) and chain of custody protocols. Each exhibit has been 
assigned a unique cryptographic fingerprint (SHA256 hash) at the time of 
original capture, and this hash has been preserved throughout all processing 
stages.

The SHA256 cryptographic hash function is a one-way function that produces 
a unique 64-character hexadecimal fingerprint for each file. Any modification 
to a file, no matter how minor, produces a completely different hash value. 
This property ensures that the court can verify, at any time, that the 
evidence has not been altered since initial capture by recomputing the hash 
and comparing it to the recorded value.

This evidence package has been prepared in accordance with best practices 
for digital evidence handling and is suitable for admission in legal 
proceedings.
```

### Usage in Affidavit

1. Include the full statement in an appendix to your affidavit
2. Reference it in the main affidavit body:
   > "The evidence submitted herewith has been processed and verified in accordance with industry-standard digital forensic protocols, as detailed in Appendix A (Defensibility Statement)."

3. Attach the master exhibit index as a supporting document

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ReportLab not installed"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install reportlab
```

### Issue: "No CSV files found"

**Check:**
1. CSV files exist in `/output` directory
2. Files have `.csv` extension
3. CSVs were generated by your processing scripts

**Fix:**
```bash
python batch_ocr_processor.py  # Re-run OCR processing
```

### Issue: "No hash values in CSV"

**Check:**
1. CSV has `file_hash` column (or `original_file_sha256`)
2. Hash values are 64-character hex strings

**Fix:**
- Re-run OCR processing with hash calculation enabled
- Or run integrity checker to add hashes:
  ```bash
  python evidence_integrity_checker.py --scan
  ```

### Issue: "External data not found"

**Check:**
1. `/external_data` directory exists
2. GeoJSON files have `.geojson` or `.json` extension
3. Email CSVs have 'email' or 'gmail' in filename

**Fix:**
```bash
mkdir external_data
# Copy your GeoJSON and email CSV files into this directory
```

### Issue: "Verification status is WARNING"

**Meaning:**
- File has a hash but integrity checker found issues
- Or no integrity database exists for cross-reference

**Action:**
- Review verification notes in exhibit PDF
- Check integrity checker logs
- Re-run integrity scan if needed

## Legal Considerations

### Admissibility

This system is designed to support evidence admissibility by:
- **Authentication**: SHA256 hashes prove files haven't been altered
- **Chain of custody**: Logging and timestamps track all operations
- **Reliability**: Industry-standard cryptographic methods
- **Best practices**: Follows digital forensic protocols

### Limitations

- **Not a substitute for legal advice**: Consult your attorney
- **Jurisdiction-specific rules**: Verify local admissibility requirements
- **Human review required**: Automated categorization may need adjustment
- **Technical testimony**: May need expert witness to explain SHA256

### Recommendations

1. **Work with your attorney** to determine:
   - Which exhibits are most relevant
   - How to present technical evidence
   - Whether expert testimony is needed

2. **Prepare to explain** the system:
   - How evidence was captured
   - How integrity was maintained
   - What SHA256 verification means

3. **Have backups**:
   - Original evidence files
   - Integrity database
   - Processing logs

---

## Support and Maintenance

### Logging

All operations are logged to `logs/legal_triage.log` with:
- Timestamps
- Operations performed
- Errors and warnings
- File counts and statistics

### Error Recovery

If processing fails:
1. Check the log file for details
2. Verify input files are accessible
3. Ensure dependencies are installed
4. Try with `--stats` mode to diagnose

### Updates

To add new legal categories:
1. Edit `LEGAL_CATEGORIES` dict in `legal_triage_suite.py`
2. Edit `CATEGORY_WEIGHTS` dict
3. Re-run triage

To change case ID:
1. Edit `CASE_ID` constant in both Python files
2. Re-run triage and exhibit generation

## Appendix: SHA256 Technical Details

### What is SHA256?

SHA256 is part of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family, designed by the NSA and published by NIST. It produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, typically rendered as a 64-character hexadecimal string.

### Properties

1. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same hash
2. **Avalanche effect**: Tiny change = completely different hash
3. **One-way**: Cannot reverse hash to get original file
4. **Collision-resistant**: Virtually impossible for two different files to have same hash

### Example

**Original file:** "screenshot_001.png" (100 KB)
**SHA256 hash:** `a3f5d8c2e1b9f4d7e6c5b8a1d2e3f4g5h6i7j8k9l0m1n2o3p4q5r6s7t8u9v0w1x2`

If one pixel changes:
**SHA256 hash:** `f9e7d6c5b4a3g2h1i0j9k8l7m6n5o4p3q2r1s0t9u8v7w6x5y4z3a2b1c0d9e8f7`

SHA256 hashing is widely accepted in:
- Digital forensics
- Court proceedings worldwide
- Law enforcement evidence handling
- Chain of custody protocols

### Verification Process for Court

1. **Submit exhibits with hash values**
2. **Court can independently verify** by:
   ```bash
   sha256sum EXHIBIT-FDSJ739-001A-*.pdf
   ```
3. **Compare computed hash to recorded hash**
4. **If they match: File is authentic and unaltered**
5. **If they don't match: File has been modified**
